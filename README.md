# Vaadin+Quarkus example project

This project runs [Vaadin 14](https://vaadin.com/) on top of Quarkus: https://quarkus.io/ .
The JBoss Undertow Servlet container is used to run Vaadin Servlet.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS - there are a couple of rough edges here and there. After
you check out the project, you need to do the following before
you attempt to run this project:

1. Edit the `MyServlet.java` class and change
   the `PROJECT_BASEDIR` configuration option to the correct path to this example project.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `code-with-quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar` file in the `/target` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/lib` directory.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/code-with-quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable (unsupported at the moment)

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/code-with-quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.html.
